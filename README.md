> The current repository is part of a personal project. The main goal is to solve all app ideas from [florinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repo.

This repo contains a challenge proposed by [florinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent. See all challenge details [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App.md).

Typescript and pure javascript DOM manipulation are the main programming languages of this repo. It "emulates" a terminal style and the user can send binary or decimal numbers. It also implements a "clear" word which clears the terminal.

**Why pure JS?** It is fast, and it is simple. The DOM manipulation required by user stories does not need complex DOM frameworks such as React, VUE.JS, etc.
